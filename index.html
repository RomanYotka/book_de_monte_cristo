   <p>One of the prototypes of the novel's hero, ${mainPerson}, was a shoemaker from Nîmes named ${mainPrototype}, who was
      engaged to a wealthy woman. In 1807, on the denunciation of ${countFakefrands} of his envious "friends" 
      <span class="accent">${listofFakefrandsWithComa}</span>
      who falsely accused him of spying for <span class="accent">${places.spyingfor}</span>, François Picot was arrested and thrown into the fortress of
      Fenestrelle, where he spent about seven years. His fourth friend, Antoine Allusion, not taking part in the plot,
      but knowing of it, cowardly kept silent about the treachery. François Picot' fiancée, after two years of fruitless
      waiting, was forced to marry ${fakefrands[0]}.
   </p>
   <p>For the first two years, François Picot did not even know what exactly he was imprisoned for. In prison, FrançoisPicot dug a small
      underground passage into a nearby cell where a wealthy Italian priest, Father Tori, was being held. They became
      friends, and François Picot nursed the sick priest, who a year later, before he died, told him the secret of the
      hidden
      treasure in <span class="accent">${places.hiddentreasure}</span>. After the fall of the imperial power in 1814, François François Picot went free, seized the
      treasure
      bequeathed to him and under a different name appeared in <span class="accent">${places.placeoforigin}</span>, where he devoted 10 years to revenge for treachery
      and perfidy.
   </p>
   <p>Schaubar was the first to be killed, but to Loopyan, his most hated enemy, a scoundrel who had stolen not only his
      freedom but also his love, François Picot presented the most cruel revenge: he enticed Loopyan's daughter into
      marriage
      with the criminal and then put him on trial and shame, which she could not endure and died from the shock. Then
      François Picot organized the burning of a restaurant belonging to Lupian and plunged him into poverty. Lupian
      son was
      implicated (or falsely accused) of stealing jewelry and the boy was imprisoned, and then Francois stabbed Lupian
      himself. Last he poisoned ${fakefrands[1]}, but, unaware of Antoine Allud's knowledge, was kidnapped and killed by him.
